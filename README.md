## About
- This is my first larger-scale Javascript project, done for homework in the Vanderbilt Coding Bootcamp, assignment due February 20, 2019. It's a simple RPG made to take advantage of jQuery's ability to execute dynamic changes in HTML pages. Uses bootstrap for better responsiveness at lower viewport sizes and on mobile devices.
